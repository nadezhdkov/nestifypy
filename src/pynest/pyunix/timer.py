pynest.pyunix.timer
-------------------
Game-aware timer system integrated into the engine loop.

This module provides a robust, frame-rate independent timer system.
Because it relies on the game loop's delta time (`dt`) rather than
system time, timers will correctly pause if the game loop pauses.

Usage:
    Timer.after(2.0, lambda: print("Boom!"))
    Timer.every(1.0, lambda: print("Tick"))
