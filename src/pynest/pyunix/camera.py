--------------------
Camera system for rendering offsets, follow, screenshake, and zoom.

This module provides a 2D camera system that calculates the necessary visual
offsets to keep a target centered on the screen, while also supporting dynamic
effects like screen shake and zooming.

Usage:
    Camera.follow(player)
    Camera.shake(intensity=5, duration=0.5)
