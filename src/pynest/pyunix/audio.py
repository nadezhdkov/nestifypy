pynest.pyunix.audio
-------------------
Audio management for music and sound effects.

This module provides a simplified interface over Pygame's mixer module.
It differentiates between background music (streamed from disk) and
sound effects (loaded entirely into memory for low-latency playback).

Usage:
    Audio.play_music("bg.mp3", loop=True, fade_ms=1000)
    Audio.play_sfx("jump.wav")
